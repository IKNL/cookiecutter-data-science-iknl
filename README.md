# Cookiecutter Data Science at IKNL

This is a Cookiecutter template for Data Science projects at IKNL. It is based on the [template by Sven van der Burg](https://github.com/svenvanderburg/cookiecutter-data-science) (you can see the [original project's homepage here](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)).

### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science

### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this:
